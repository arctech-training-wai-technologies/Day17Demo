        <h1>Wishing for a holiday</h1>
    
        <p>
        Alone at home, staring at a screen,<br/>
        My class is on, for me to learn.<br/>
        My friends I see, only online,<br/>
        when before I could meet them, at every turn.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alone at home, watching the sunrise,<br/>
        The chirping of birds, singing of the rolling tide.<br/>
        Thinking of people, watching the sunset,<br/>
        Why can't I visit that land? I cried.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alone at home, staring at a screen,<br/>
        Watching moving pictures of a distant land.<br/>
        I strain my ears listening to my father talk,<br/>
        wishing I was on a beach holding his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alone at home, dreaming of times,<br/>
        when my parents would say.<br/>
        Daughter my dear, are you ready,<br/>
        to go on a jet plane for an exciting holiday.
        </p>
        <p>
        Alone at home, staring at a screen,<br/>
        watching people from cities far away.<br/>
        Writing down in my diary,<br/>
        So I can go say hello to them, some day
        </p>
